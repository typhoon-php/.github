Hello, PHP developer!

If you've ever used static analysis in your PHP projects, you probably wondered how all these cool phpDoc types could
be applied to runtime tools like serializers, dependency injection containers, API doc generators, etc.

Typhoon's mission is to give you everything you need to accomplish this:

- [A rich type system abstraction](https://github.com/typhoon-php/typhoon/blob/0.4.x/docs/type.md) compatible with Psalm
  and PHPStan.
- [Static reflection](https://github.com/typhoon-php/typhoon/blob/0.4.x/docs/reflection.md) supporting phpDoc types and
  generics.
- More tools coming soon!
