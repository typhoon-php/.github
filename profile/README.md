Hello, PHP developer!

If you ever used static analysis tools in your projects, then you've probably wondered, how all these sophisticated
types could be used in runtime tools like serializers, dependency injection containers, API doc generators, etc.

Typhoon's mission is to give you everything you might need to accomplish this:

- a rich type system, compatible with Psalm and PHPStan,
- static reflection, supporting phpDoc types and generics.
